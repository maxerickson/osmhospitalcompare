# osmhospitalcompare

Each file has 2 reports. 

The numbered list is a result of going through hospital data from Medicare and trying to find a match in OSM. Medicare listings that don't have a strong match are reported. The reported entries say CMS=yes or CMS=no to indicate whether Medicare lists the hospital as providing emergency services.

The next report works in the other direction, going through hospitals in OSM that have an emergency=yes tag and trying to match them in the Medicare data.

The Medicare data is from [https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-General-Information/xubh-q36u](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-General-Information/xubh-q36u).
